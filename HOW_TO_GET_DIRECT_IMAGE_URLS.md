# How to Get Direct Image URLs from Google Images üñºÔ∏è

## The Problem:
When you right-click and "Copy image address" from Google Images search results, you get a **redirect URL** like:
```
https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthshots.com...
```
This won't work in React Native! ‚ùå

## The Solution - Get Direct Image URLs:

### Method 1: Right-Click on the Image (Recommended)
1. Go to Google Images and search for your yoga pose
2. Click on the image you want
3. In the preview panel on the right, **right-click directly on the large image**
4. Select **"Open image in new tab"**
5. Copy the URL from that new tab - this is the DIRECT image URL! ‚úÖ
6. It should look like: `https://www.healthshots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/...balasana.jpg`

### Method 2: Visit the Source Website
1. From Google Images, click **"Visit"** button under the image
2. Find the image on the source website
3. Right-click on the image ‚Üí **"Open image in new tab"**
4. Copy that URL

### Method 3: Use "View Image" (if available)
1. Some browsers have a "View Image" button in Google Images
2. Click it to open the direct image
3. Copy the URL

## Example - Getting Balasana (Child's Pose) Image:

### ‚ùå Wrong URL (Google redirect):
```
https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthshots.com%2Ffitness%2Fstaying-fit%2Fbalasana-childs-pose-benefits%2F&psig=AOvVaw2FoaEQaqoFu-DPVMyHTAk9&ust=1760902955280000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBUQjRxqFwoTCKi75YPBrpADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE
```

### ‚úÖ Correct URL (Direct image):
```
https://www.healthshots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/balasana-childs-pose.jpg
