# PcoSense v1.0.4 - Critical Fixes Applied

## Build Information
- **Version**: 1.0.4
- **Version Code**: 5
- **Build Date**: October 23, 2025
- **Build Status**: In Progress via EAS Build

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Edit Section Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Clicking the edit button in profile screen didn't allow editing of user information.

**Root Cause**: 
- `TextInput` components were incorrectly nested inside `Text` components
- This is invalid in React Native and caused the inputs to not render or function

**Solution**:
- Restructured the component to conditionally render either `TextInput` OR `Text`
- Added proper styling for edit mode inputs
- Fixed all input fields: Name, Age, Weight, Height

**Files Modified**: `src/screens/ProfileScreen.js`

---

### 2. Water Tracker Not Working ✅
**Problem**: 
- Water intake didn't persist between app sessions
- + and - buttons weren't updating the count
- Always started at 6 glasses instead of 0

**Root Cause**:
- No AsyncStorage implementation for water data
- Initial state was hardcoded to 6
- No save functionality on button clicks

**Solution**:
- Implemented `loadWaterData()` to restore water intake on app launch
- Implemented `saveWaterData()` to persist changes
- Fixed + button to increment water count (max 8)
- Fixed - button to decrement water count (min 0)
- Added daily reset at midnight
- Changed initial value from 6 to 0

**Files Modified**: `src/screens/HomeScreen.js`

---

### 3. Step Counter Not Working ✅
**Problem**: 
- App crashed when trying to access step counter features
- Phone sensors weren't being utilized

**Root Cause**:
- Missing state variable declarations (`stepUpdateInterval`, `movementDetectorAvailable`)
- Incomplete useEffect cleanup

**Solution**:
- Added all required state variables
- Implemented proper cleanup in useEffect
- Fixed phone step counter integration
- Added fallback simulation mode

**Files Modified**: `src/screens/HomeScreen.js`

---

### 4. Medicine Widget Integration ✅
**Problem**: Medicine widget wasn't showing medicines added in the Medicine section.

**Status**: The widget implementation was correct. The fix to HomeScreen state management ensures it now works properly with Firebase data.

**Files Modified**: No changes needed, fixed by HomeScreen improvements

---

## Technical Details

### State Management Fixes
```javascript
// Added missing state variables
const [stepUpdateInterval, setStepUpdateInterval] = useState(null);
const [movementDetectorAvailable, setMovementDetectorAvailable] = useState(false);
```

### Data Persistence
```javascript
// Water tracker now uses AsyncStorage
const loadWaterData = async () => { /* ... */ };
const saveWaterData = async (glasses) => { /* ... */ };
```

### Component Structure Fix
```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
<Text>{editing ? <TextInput ... /> : 'Value'}</Text>

// After (CORRECT):
{editing ? <TextInput ... /> : <Text>Value</Text>}
```
