## 🎯 Two Main Distribution Methods

### Method 1: Direct APK Download (Recommended for Testing)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast (20 minutes)
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Share instantly

**Cons:**
- ❌ Users must enable "Unknown Sources"
- ❌ No automatic updates
- ❌ Less trusted than Play Store

**How:**
```bash
cd PcoSense
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

---

### Method 2: Google Play Store (Recommended for Production)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Most trusted
- ✅ Automatic updates
- ✅ Easy installation (just click Install)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Takes 1-7 days for approval
- ❌ Costs $25 (one-time)
- ❌ Requires more setup

**How:**
```bash
cd PcoSense
eas build --platform android --profile production
eas submit --platform android
```

## 🎬 Recommended Workflow

### For First Time:
1. ✅ Build APK (`preview` profile)
2. ✅ Test on your phone
3. ✅ Share with 5-10 friends for beta testing
4. ✅ Gather feedback
5. ✅ Fix bugs
6. ✅ Then publish to Play Store (`production` profile)

### This approach lets you:
- Test thoroughly before public release
- Get early feedback
- Avoid Play Store rejections
- Have both options available

## 🛠️ What You Need

### Already Have:
- ✅ React Native/Expo app (PcoSense)
- ✅ Configuration files (I created them)
- ✅ Documentation (I created it)

### You Need to Get:
- [ ] Expo account (free - create at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev))
- [ ] EAS CLI installed (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- [ ] (Optional) Google Play Developer account ($25)

---

## ⚡ Copy-Paste Command (All-in-One)

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli && eas login && cd PcoSense && eas build:configure && eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This single command:
1. Installs EAS CLI
2. Logs you in to Expo
3. Navigates to PcoSense folder
4. Configures the project
5. Builds the APK
6. Gives you a download link

**Time**: 20 minutes total (most is build time)

## 🔄 Future Updates

When you update your app:

### 1. Update Version Numbers
Edit `PcoSense/app.json`:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "version": "1.0.1",     // Was 1.0.0
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 2      // Was 1
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Build Again
```bash
cd PcoSense
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### 3. Share New Link
Users will need to install the new APK (or it auto-updates if on Play Store)
