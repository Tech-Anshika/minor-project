## üöÄ Quick Start: Build and Share APK (Easiest Method)

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Expo
```bash
eas login
```
*If you don't have an Expo account, create one at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)*

### Step 3: Configure EAS Build
```bash
cd PcoSense
eas build:configure
```

### Step 4: Build APK for Distribution
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**What happens next:**
- EAS will build your app in the cloud
- You'll get a download link when it's done (usually 10-20 minutes)
- The link will look like: `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/[unique-id].apk`

### Step 5: Share the Download Link
Once the build completes:
1. Copy the APK download link from the terminal
2. Share this link with anyone
3. They can download and install it on their Android phone

**Note**: Users need to enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in their phone settings.

## üåê Hosting Your APK for Download

After building, you can host your APK on:

```

### 2. **Google Drive** (Simple)
1. Upload APK to Google Drive
2. Right-click ‚Üí Get shareable link
3. Change permissions to "Anyone with the link"
4. Share the link

### 3. **Firebase Hosting** (Professional)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
# Upload APK to hosting
```

### 4. **Expo's Built-in Hosting** (Temporary)
- The link from `eas build` works for 30 days
- After that, you need to re-upload elsewhere

---

## üì§ Submit to Google Play Store

### Step 1: Create a Google Play Console Account
- Go to [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)
